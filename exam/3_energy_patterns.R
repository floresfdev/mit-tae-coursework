# PATTERNS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION
# 
# The use of coal in the United States peaked in 2005, and since then has 
# decreased by 25%, being replaced by renewable energy sources and more 
# efficient use (Lovins, 2014). As the United States pursues a portfolio of more
# diverse, sustainable and secure energy sources, there are many questions to 
# consider. What are effective factors in incentivizing states to adopt more 
# environmentally friendly energy generation methods? How do these factors vary 
# by state? How can we direct resources to different places in the country and
# ensure that they effectively drive renewable energy sources adoption? To 
# derive insights and answer these questions, we take a combination of 
# generation, usage, and greenhouse emission data by state and combine it with
# macro-economic and political information.
# 
# For this problem, we gathered data from various sources to include the 
# following information for each state within the U.S. for the years spanning 
# year 2000 to year 2013. The aggregated dataset energy.csv results in a total 
# of 27 variables and 699 observations. Each observation contains one record per
# state per year. Here's a detailed description of the variables:
# 
# - GenTotal: Annual generation of energy using all types of energy sources 
# (coal, nuclear, hydroelectric, solar, etc.) normalized by the state population
# at a given year.
# 
# - GenTotalRenewable: Annual generation of energy using all renewable energy 
# sources normalized by the state population at a given year.
# 
# - GenHydro, GenSolar: Annual generation of energy using each type of energy 
# source as a percent of the total energy generation.
# 
# - GenTotalRenewableBinary, GenSolarBinary: 1 if generation from solar or other
# renewable energy sources increased between a year n and a year n+1. 0 if it 
# did not increase.
# 
# - AllSourcesCO2, AllSourcesSO2 and AllSourcesNOx: Annual emissions per state 
# in metric tons, normalized by the respective state population at a given year
# and caused by all energy generation sources.
# 
# - EPriceResidential, EPriceCommercial, EPriceIndustrial, EPriceTransportation,
# EPriceTotal: Average electricity price per state, per sector (residential, 
# industrial, commercial, etc.)
# 
# - ESalesResidential, ESalesCommercial, ESalesIndustrial, ESalesTransportation,
# ESalesTotal: Annual normalized sales of electricity per state, per sector.
# 
# - CumlRegulatory, CumlFinancial: Number of energy-related financial incentives
# and regulations created by a state per year.
# 
# - Demographic data such as annual wages per capita and presidential results 
# (0 if a state voted republican, 1 is democrat).


# Problem 1 - Total Renewable Energy Generation
# Load energy.csv into a data frame called energy.
energy <- read.csv("./data_3/energy.csv")
str(energy)
summary(energy)
# Renewable energy sources are considered to include geothermal, hydroelectric, 
# biomass, solar and wind.

# Which state in the United States seems to have the highest total generation 
# of energy from renewable sources (use the variable GenTotalRenewable)?
energy[which.max(energy$GenTotalRenewable), ]
## Idaho (ID)

# Which year did the above state produce the highest energy generation from 
# renewable resources?
## 2000


# Problem 2 - Relationship Between Politics and Greenhouse Emissions
# What is the average CO2 emissions from all sources of energy for:

# - states during years in which they voted republican?
mean(subset(energy, presidential.results == 0)$AllSourcesCO2, na.rm = TRUE)
## 16.44296

# - states during years in which they voted democrat?
mean(subset(energy, presidential.results == 1)$AllSourcesCO2, na.rm = TRUE)
## 5.783781

# Note: Please use na.rm = TRUE in your calculations!

# States that voted democrat have on average higher NOx emissions than states 
# that voted republican across all years. Is this statement true or false?
mean(subset(energy, presidential.results == 0)$AllSourcesNOx, na.rm = TRUE)
### Republican average = 0.02985461
mean(subset(energy, presidential.results == 1)$AllSourcesNOx, na.rm = TRUE)
### Democrat average = 0.009377028
## False


# Problem 3 - Relationship Between Greenhouse Emissions and Energy Sales
# What is the correlation between overall CO2 emissions and energy sales made to
# industrial facilities? Note that the variables AllSourcesCO2 and 
# EsalesIndustrial contain NAs. Use the parameter: use="complete" to handle NAs 
# in this question.
cor(energy$AllSourcesCO2, energy$EsalesIndustrial, use = "complete")
## 0.5385867

# Choose the correct answers from the following statements:
cor(energy$AllSourcesSO2, energy$EsalesIndustrial, use = "complete")
### 0.4812317
cor(energy$AllSourcesNOx, energy$EsalesResidential, use = "complete")
### -0.5038829
cor(energy$AllSourcesCO2, energy$EsalesCommercial, use = "complete")
### -0.373383
## Overall SO2 emissions are likely higher with increased industrial energy 
## sales


# Problem 4 - Boxplot of Energy Prices per State
# Create a boxplot of the total energy price (EPriceTotal) by State across the 
# data, and a table summarizing the mean of EPriceTotal by State.
library(ggplot2)
priceBoxplot <- ggplot(energy, aes(STATE, EPriceTotal)) 
priceBoxplot + geom_boxplot()
# What observations do you make?
## - The boxplot shows a clear outlier, the state of Hawaii, with much higher 
##   energy price compared to the rest of the U.S.
## - When looking at the average energy prices, there seems to be three price 
##   tiers ($5-$9, $10-$14, and $20+)

# Which state has the lowest average energy price of all? You might want to make
# a table to answer this question.

# Is this state associated with the highest mean total energy generation 
# (GenTotal)?
avgGenByState <- aggregate(GenTotal ~ STATE, energy, mean)

avgGenByState[which.max(avgGenByState$GenTotal), ]
## True


# Problem 5 - Prediction Model for Solar Generation
# We are interested in predicting whether states are going to increase their 
# solar energy generation over the next year. Let's subset our dataset into a
# training and a testing set by using the following commands:
set.seed(144)
spl <- sample(1 : nrow(energy), size = 0.7 * nrow(energy))
train <- energy[spl, ]
test <- energy[-spl, ]
# Let's build now a logistic regression model "mod" using the train set to 
# predict the binary variable GenSolarBinary. To do so, we consider the 
# following as potential predictive variables: GenHydro, GenSolar, 
# CumlFinancial, CumlRegulatory, Total.salary, Import.
mod <- glm(GenSolarBinary ~ GenHydro + GenSolar + CumlFinancial + 
               CumlRegulatory + Total.salary + Import, 
           data = train,
           family = binomial)
# Which variable is most predictive in the model?
summary(mod)
## CumlRegulatory


# Problem 6 - Performance on the Test Set
# Compute the predictions on the test set. Using a threshold of 0.5, what is the
# accuracy of our model on the test set?
predTest <- predict(mod, newdata = test, type = "response")
table(test$GenSolarBinary, predTest > 0.5)

# Problem 7 - Clustering of the Observations
# We can perhaps improve our accuracy if we implement a cluster-the-predict 
# approach. We are interested in clustering the observations based on 
# information about the regulatory and financial incentives, the elections 
# outcome and the population wealth in each state across the years, in addition
# to whether the state was an energy importer or not.

# Let us create a train.limited and test.limited datasets, where we only keep 
# the variables CumlRegulatory, CumlFinancial, presidential.results, 
# Total.salary, and Import.
str(train)
train.limited <- subset(train, select = CumlFinancial:Import)

# Why didn't we include the dependent variable GenSolarBinary in this clustering
# phase?
## - Needing to know the dependent variable value to assign an observation to a
##   cluster defeats the purpose of the cluster-then-predict methodology

# the maximum number of iterations at 1,000.
